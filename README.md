### CECS-579-Project  

**Implementing a VPN using OpenVPN Library and Executing and observing well-known attacks.**

The goals of the project include  
1) Learning to setup a VPN using OpenVPN.  
2) Learning about the possible attacks on VPN.  
3) Observing the reasons of success and failure of the above attacks.  

**The Motivation**  
Virtual Private Networks (VPN), extend a private network over a public network such as Internet. This method is used by a lot of companies, so that the employees can use the company network from home using the internet. VPN seems very similar to wide area network (WAN). The users can access the resources the same way as resources available within the private network. Security is a main concern as the users access the VPN through internet, which is prone to attacks. Hence, the motivation behind this project is to understand a VPN, learn to set it up using the OpenVPN tool and learn about the encryption and protocols that are used in configuring a VPN. Also to execute some well-known attacks and observe the findings and reasons for them to be successful or unsuccessful.    

**Project Timeline**      
**1) 14th Sept - 2nd Oct**  
   **-** Understanding the OpenVPN tool, this will include the following activities :  
   **-** Installing OpenVPN.  
   **-** Determining whether to use a routed or bridged VPN.  
   **-** Numbering private subnets.  
   **-** Setting up a Certificate Authority (CA) and generating certificates and keys for an OpenVPN server and multiple clients.      
   **-** Creating configuration files for server and clients.  
   **-** Starting up the VPN and testing for initial connectivity.  
   **-** Configuring OpenVPN to run automatically on system startup.    
**2) 3rd Oct - 20th Oct**  
   **-** Controlling and setting up clients.    
   **-** Finishing the Setup of VPN.  
   **-** Drafting a possible list of attacks that can be done.  
**3) 21st Oct - 20th Nov**  
   **-** Executing the attacks on the existing setup and making observations of the same.  
   **-** Reasons behind success or failure of attacks and drafting and finalising a report.
